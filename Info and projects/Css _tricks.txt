input.ng-touched.ng-invalid{

}


------------------ Displying the particular font size as large and red in css ---------

suppose we want to show the price of a book as large and red we can use stylxe = font-sizen: x-large which will increase the size if font to big and we can 
use color as color:#db3208 for red color.

example:
 <a (click)="onSelectBook(book)" style="font-size: x-large;color:#db3208"> // css for large font-size and red color
                {{book.ourPrice | currency: 'USD' }}

<option>...</option>

What happens is this drop down will be displayed below label but what we want is drop down to be displayed in same line as label

example : 
<select id = .. class = .. style = "display:inline;">
<option>... </option>
</select>
